# Revised-Simplex

The Revised Simplex Method is an algorithm for solving linear programming problems. This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the Revised Simplex Method, which can be used to solve a variety of optimization problems.

### Overview of the Revised Simplex Method:
The Revised Simplex Method is an extension of the Simplex Method, which is a popular algorithm for solving linear programming problems. Like the Simplex Method, the Revised Simplex Method is an iterative algorithm that starts with an initial feasible solution and iteratively improves the solution until an optimal solution is found.

The main difference between the Simplex Method and the Revised Simplex Method is that the Revised Simplex Method uses a different approach for selecting the entering and leaving variables at each iteration. Instead of using the standard simplex pivot rule, the Revised Simplex Method uses a different pivot rule that can be more efficient for certain types of problems.

<!--The Revised Simplex Method is particularly useful for solving large-scale linear programming problems, where the number of variables and constraints is very large. It can also be used to solve problems with special structure, such as problems with block-angular structure or problems with sparse matrices.-->
